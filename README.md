Hello Connie,

I did have an account set up, I just didn't really use it.

I am picking through some older code snippets trying to find some interesting items. Most of it is not.

1 - accordion - a simple accordion and contextual html that hides and reveals text and changes an indicator image on click, done in jQuery and Bootstrap

2 - appointment-banner - a strategically placed appointment banner in all pages that are not the appointment page, search "jw", simple change in WordPress PHP

3 - dynamic-image-wp-php - add the ability to place a featured image on the woocommerce and other pages if one exists, search "jw"

3 - error-404-ambigram-rotate - I really enjoy creating ambigrams which are words that appear the same way upside-down and right side up, and designed my 404 page at http://jonwogen.com/g to be a bit confusing as the user clicks buttons the ambigram rotates to reveal itself

4 - flash-actionscript - I included this for fun, the flash animation is all in actionscript with no timeline movement, http://jonwogen.com/project2/index.html, click step one, then click through the animation (you just have to figure out where to click)

5 - form - contact form at jonwogen.com, done in php

6 - full-width - added social icons to pages that are not the front page, similar to the appointment banner add, also a seminar banner using a dynamic sidebar widget, php search "jw"

7 - mobile-jQuery - on the jonwogen.com site, the top hides and reveals sections, the bottom refreshes the page to change the look at 480px, then again when resized larger and waits an amount of time to refresh

8 - sticky-nav - secondary navigation on this particular page, sticks after scrolling past a certain height, links that are clicked to anchors keep an active link look.

9 - toggle - not sure why I am including this as it is clunky, this is some toggle and image switching jQuery, not accordion style, I got it to do what I needed it to do but it doesn't look pretty, it looks like I could have used arrays and set up a loop
