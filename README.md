Hello Connie,

I did have an account set up, I just didn't really use it.

I am picking through some older code snippets trying to find some interesting items. Most of it is not.

1 - accordion - a simple accordion and contextual html that hides and reveals text and changes an indicator image on click, done in jQuery and Bootstrap

2 - appointment-banner - a strategically placed appointment banner in all pages that are not the appointment page, search "jw added appointment banner", simple change in WordPress PHP

3 - form - contact form at jonwogen.com, done in php

4 - full-width - added social icons to pages that are not the front page, similar to the appointment banner add, php search "jw"

5 - sticky-nav - secondary navigation on this particular page, sticks after scrolling past a certain height, links that are clicked to anchors keep an active link look.

6 - toggle - not sure why I am including this as it is clunky, this is some toggle and image switching jQuery, not accordion style, I got it to do what I needed it to do but it doesn't look pretty, it looks like I could have used arrays and set up a loop
